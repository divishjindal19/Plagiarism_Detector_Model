# Plagiarism Detector Using Machine Learning
# Introduction
Plagiarism detection is a critical tool in both academic and professional environments. With the power of machine learning, we can develop an intelligent system capable of identifying copied content with high accuracy. This project demonstrates how to build a plagiarism detector from scratch, starting with dataset collection and culminating in a user-friendly Flask web application.

# Dataset Collection
The foundation of any machine learning project is a high-quality dataset. For this plagiarism detector, we need a dataset that includes pairs of text documentsâ€”one original and one plagiarized. Such datasets can be sourced from platforms like Kaggle or manually curated by collecting text samples. In this project, we use a custom dataset containing pairs of original and plagiarized documents, which will help train our model to differentiate between authentic and copied content.

# Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the text data must be preprocessed to ensure consistency and improve model performance. The preprocessing steps include:

Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.

Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.

Removing Punctuation: Eliminating punctuation marks to avoid unnecessary noise in the data.

Stopwords Removal: Filtering out common words (e.g., "the", "and") that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text.

# Building the Machine Learning Model
To transform the text data into numerical features, we use the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer. This technique helps capture the importance of words in the context of the document. We then train a logistic regression model using these features to classify text pairs as either original or plagiarized.

# Flask Web Application
To make the plagiarism detector accessible and user-friendly, we developed a Flask-based web application. This application provides a simple interface where users can input two text documents and receive a plagiarism score. The backend processes the input, applies the trained model, and returns the result in real-time.
